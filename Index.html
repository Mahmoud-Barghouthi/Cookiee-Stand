            Our Salmon Cookies are part of our 'Love' treats range. The ‘Love’ category contains a range of deliciously
            different treats, that are great for owners who just want to show their dogs they are loved. Interesting,
            intriguing, different and delicious.

            These tasty, crunchy biscuits are made with responsibly sourced salmon, whitefish and sweet potato (a
            delicious and healthy alternative to white potato)

            They are grain free, contain no artificial preservatives or colourings, are low in calories and are a great
            alternative to naughty human biscuits.
